In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined. Consider this scenario:  You intend to increment a counter associated with a specific key in an array, but that key might not exist yet.  If you directly access `$myArray["someKey"]++`, and "someKey" is absent, instead of initializing the key to 0 and then incrementing, you'll receive a notice-level error and the counter won't behave as expected. 

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["someKey"]++; // Notice: Undefined index: someKey
echo $myArray["someKey"]; // Outputs 1 (but the error happened)
```
